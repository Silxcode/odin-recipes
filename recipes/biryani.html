    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There are many, many biscuit recipes out there. Everyone who has some familiarity with biscuit making (along with their mother, and their grandmother) seems to have an opinion about the best way to make them. But what about those of us who don't come from families with generations-old recipes? If you're just starting out, you need a recipe with very specific and tactile instructions, not just someone telling you to stir it all together until "it feels right." To find the best one, I baked six batches of biscuits, 
        all from highly popular recipes available on the internet, in a single afternoon — following the instructions closely and noting the differences.</p>
    <p>What I learned was that there are two basic elements to every biscuit recipe: the ingredients, and the technique. If you find a biscuit recipe with an ingredient list that appeals to you, you can actually mix and match the techniques from other recipes (things like using a food processor or baking at a certain temperature). As you're just starting to try baking biscuits, you'll want a recipe with more specific instructions, but as you become more comfortable 
        with your technique, you won't need to follow those instructions quite as closely.</p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour holds the ingredients together. Also, the protein in flour (when combined with moisture and heat) creates gluten, which provides structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking Powder:</strong> Baking powder, not yeast, is used as a leavener in this easy biscuit recipe. It causes the dough to expand, giving the biscuits volume and texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt:</strong>Salt acts as a flavor enhancer and it strengthens the protein in the dough</li>
        <li><strong>Shortening:</strong> Shortening is made of purely fat, unlike butter which contains water and milk solids. This means it's better at reducing (or "shortening!") gluten strands, resulting in a soft and crumbly biscuit.</li>
        <li><strong>Milk:</strong>Cold milk adds moisture, flavor, and structure to the biscuit dough.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> Sift the dry ingredients into a large bowl. Cut in the shortening, then add the milk. Mix until the dough is soft and doesn't stick to the side of the bowl.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Knead and Roll:</strong> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly. Roll the dough into an even sheet that's about ½-inch thick.</li>
        <li><strong>Cut and Bake:</strong> Use a lightly floured biscuit cutter to cut out the biscuits. Place the cut biscuits on an ungreased baking sheet. Re-roll the dough, repeating the cutting process, until all the dough is gone. Bake until golden brown.</li>
        
    </ol>
